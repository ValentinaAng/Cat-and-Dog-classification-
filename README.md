# Dog and Cat Image-classification

This Python project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images as either cats or dogs. The dataset comprises 5000 training images, with the primary objective being to train a model capable of accurately distinguishing between cats and dogs. Due to GPU limitations, loading the entire dataset posed a challenge, but efforts were made to manage this constraint effectively.
